        <h2>Me & tech</h2>
        <p>I'm <b>Deborah Danjuma</b>, a frontend web developer in-training. Learning web development 
        is something I enjoy doing as a young techie. Asides web dev, I also absolutely love <i>engineering</i>, as it is a vast field hosting lots of innovations and inventions that has transformed 
        the evolution of technology. I see technology as a relly interesting field that allows me to 
        put in practice the theories of science....and that's where the real fun is!</p>

        <h2>My Web Development journey & CSS</h2>
        <p>As I said, I'm a frontend web developer in-training. Currently, I am learning the fundamentals with <a href="https://www.stutern.com/"><b>STUTERN</b></a> and it's been an informative learning period so far.
            We have covered the basics of HTML, and have moved on to CSS <i>(Cascading Style Sheets)</i>. I now understand
            how critical CSS is to a webpage in terms of styling, and even the page layout. CSS acts as a useful tool for 
            employing diverse styles (color, background, text formats, orientation, etc) to a webpage to make it look presentable to
            the viewer. And <a href="https://www.stutern.com/"><b>STUTERN</b></a> is doing a great job in showing me how to use it.

        <h2>Padding vs Margin vs Border</h2>
        <p>The <i><b>margin</b></i> property is the space around elements on a webpage, pretty much like the margin lines found in note books. 
            It's the outermost part of any webpage element that 'separates' it from other elements around it. The <i><b>border</b></i> property is 
            the space surrounding a webpage element, just after the margin. The property can be styled and made visible using CSS. The <i><b>padding</b></i>
            property is the space around the element just after the border, between the actual content and the border. This property can be used 
            to 'cushion' the webpage element content within the border. Thus, every webpage element is surrounded by (in order) a: <b>padding</b> >
            <b>border</b> > <b>margin</b>. An image is shown below to further understand the difference:
